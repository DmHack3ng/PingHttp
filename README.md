# 🌐 PingHttp

**PingHttp** is a lightweight Python script designed to **check the availability of domains or subdomains over HTTP AND HTTPS**.
It’s simple, straightforward, and easy to use — ideal for quickly testing if a target is up and responding.

## ✨ Features

* 🔎 **HTTP/(S) status check** – get the exact status code returned by each domain.
* ⚡ **Timeout handling** – no more hanging requests, each check respects a timeout.
* 🛡️ **Error management** – gracefully catches unreachable hosts, connection refusals, and timeouts.
* 📄 **Readable output** – clean, structured results printed directly in your terminal.

## 🚀 Example Usage

```bash
python3 PingHttp.py -s example.com
```

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PingHttp.git
cd PingHttp
python3 PingHttp.py
```

💡 *Note:* Future versions of **PingHttp** will include **multithreading** support for faster scanning of large domain lists. Stay tuned! 🚀
